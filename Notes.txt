Approach:
	Open using CSV library
	Identify the floor plan column by searching for header with "unit type"/variations
	Move unit type to column 0
	Sort all rows by unit type in alphebetical order
	Loop through each unit type and remove all but the lowest price
		Use two pointers
			while pointer 2 is not "" iterate pointer 2:
				if pointer 2 == pointer 1:

					if pointer 1 <= pointer 2:
						delete row 2
					else:
						delete row 1
						pointer 1 = pointer 2
				else:
					pointer 1 = pointer 2
	Remove all extraneous columns
	


Input:
	CSV table with miscellaneous data

Output:
	CSV data with extraneous data removed and remaining data formatted
		Remaining Data:
			Floor plan (Ex: A1)
			Price
			Sq Footage
			Unit type (Ex: 1 br)
			Unit type name (1x1)
		Remove:
			Duplicates
			Categories not shown above
			
Edge cases:
	Necessary data may not be included
	Column headers for the same data type may be slightly different
	Lowest price for each floor plan should be returned

Assumptions:
	Floor plan should be in column #1
	Order of returned data does not matter
	Columns are not always in the same order
	Column names are not always exactly the same
